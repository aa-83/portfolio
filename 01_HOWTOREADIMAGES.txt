### How to Read the Images
To be able read the .jpgs they have to be opened in a text editor, hex editor
with ASCII support, or a word processor.

Examples of hex editors:
- Bless (Linux)
- Hexedit (MacOS)
- WinHex (Windows)

Examples of text editors:
- Vim
- Emacs
- Notepad (Windows)
- TextEdir (MacOS)

Examples of word processors:
- Microsoft Word
- OpenOffice Writer
- LibreOffice Writer
- Apple Pages (MacOS)
- Google Docs

Any of these programs should be able to open the images I have made. Inside the
images there is a lot of text. The reason is because if not, the images would
mostly be a grey solid. To separate between the repetitions I have but up these
signs /* */ with the text being inbetween these signs. Also since images are not
supposed to be opened in text programs, the formatting will be weird, and it is
often necessary to scroll horizontally for text editors and vertically for word
processors.
