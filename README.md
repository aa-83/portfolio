# About my Portfolio
This is my Portfolio that I am handing in as a part of my Artstict Research
module spring 2020 at the Danish School of Performing Arts. In this folder I
want to put in all the bits and pieces I have found out during the last four
weeks. All in all I hope to combine pieces of all my different experiments. To
have a look at the work I have been doing, click

have done click

#### Quick info
Before you start digging to deep into this project I will reccomend you to check
out the HOWTO guide's first. They are numbered 01, 02, and so on, to suggest a
path through this project that will hopefully make it easier to understand what
it is I have been doing here. Also note that this is confusing stuff, if it hard
to understand, please know that I do not understand most of the things going on,
and I am trying my best to use my own lacking understanding of what is going to
explain what is happening.

### Indexing System
The first thing to note is that I have numbers prepended to the filenames to
help guide whoever is looking at this. If not It would
be sort of hard to get a good overview. They suggest an order to read documents
and open images.

### Content Selection
The second thing is figuring what sort of content to show. There will be
included some texts in here. This notes.txt that has been a major part in this
project trying to explain what sort of ideas I have. I will also include some of
the how-to's as well since the help guides will be usefull and arguable
completely necesary for understanding this project. Especially the
HOWTOREADIMAGES.txt.

### Image Creation
The third thing is of course the images. I will build on one of the ideas I had
in the thoughts_on_open_source experiments. This is that each file should only
make one line of pixels in the image. But each images should be one row further
down than the previous. I do not think this is clearly illustrated in the
thoughts_on_open_source folder. This is also because it takes a lot of data to
fill a picture, and I have not prioritised to do that. With the portfolio I am
not tied up in the same way to include my stream of conciousness in regard to
open source. So I will fill the images by using content from my other
experiments as well. This means that my lines will include single letter images
as well as some of Shakespeare's sonnets. I will choose the letters and sonnets
based on the images they created that I liked the most.

#### Finishing Remarks
I have also included the template and the original it is based on to show from
where this images has started.
